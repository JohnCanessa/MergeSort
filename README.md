# MergeSort
Merge Sort algorithm in Java

Both Quick Sort and Merge Sort are very common algorithms implemented
by different libraries on different programming languages.

I spent some time reading and experimenting with Sort Merge.

If you are interested in my comments I invite you to read the following
associated post in my blog:

Keep in mind that reading and experiemnting is one of the best ways to
learn and refresh your knowledge.

Enjoy;
